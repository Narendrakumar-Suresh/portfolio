          I am a passionate front-end developer with a keen interest in machine
          learning (ML) and deep learning (DL). My journey in the tech world
          started with creating dynamic and responsive web applications, where I
          honed my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Over time, I expanded my
          expertise into ML and DL, exploring the fascinating realms of
          artificial intelligence and data science. This combination of
          front-end development and ML/DL allows me to bring a unique
          perspective to my projects, merging the best of user experience design
          and advanced data analytics.

          Beyond my professional interests, I am a dedicated Taekwondo athlete,
          embracing the discipline and physical challenges the sport offers. I
          believe in the power of continuous learning, which is why I am an avid
          reader, always seeking knowledge through books across various genres.
          Additionally, I enjoy sharing my insights and experiences through
          blogging, which has been a great way to connect with like-minded
          individuals. Recently, I have ventured into content creation,
          leveraging platforms to share my journey in tech, sports, and personal
          development, aiming to inspire and educate a broader audience.
